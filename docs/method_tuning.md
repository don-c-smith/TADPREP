## Method: `reshape`
### Core Purpose:
Perform row- or column-dependent instance (row) removals, as well as feature (column) removals.

### Parameters:
- `df` Input Pandas dataframe.
- `features_to_reshape` (list[str]) 
- `verbose` (Boolean, default = True) Controls level of detail in output.

### Returns:
- Modified dataframe containing only the subset of instances not removed by user.

### Current State:
- Docstrings updated for all but drop_columns child func.

- ***UX-focused elements factored out of current build
  - A bit hardline on this for now, avoiding additional user input beyond confirmation of operations.
- Core Functionality:
  - Provides user 3 options for reshaping by removal:
    - 1. Row-dependent row removal
      - Provides user with a default missingness threshold
      - Sums, by row, total missing features
      - Encodes, by row, whether those rows' missingness is at/above threshold
    - 2. Column-dependent row removal
      - Displays row missingness by features provided
      - Removes rows with missingness in 'features_to_reshape'
    - 3. Column removal
      - This might not need to exist outside of UX
      - Would likely just be a pandas wrapper

- "Verbosity" differentiation not fully implemented
  - I'm leaning toward this as a UX-side feature of the package
  - Full method functionality is a bit dense with all of the "possible" info the user is getting or not.

### Observed Bugs/Problems:
- testing of current iteration incomplete
  - bugs not detected so far

### Ideas for Development:
- Data types considered "missing" could be subject to user interpretation
  - Consider implementing options for these
- "Architecture" of package as related to this method needs clarifying w/ Don
  - What functionality should go in `transforms.py` vs `tadprep_interactive.py`

### Method History:
- Alpha build by Don Smith
- Beta build by Gabor Horvath (Current State)


## Class: `PlotHandler`
### Core Purpose:

  -  Generates and stores a Seaborn plot for a specified pandas DataFrame column with plot type determined by user input.
- `.det_plot_type(self, df, col_name):`
  - Determines an appropriate plot type for a set of data (pd.Series) based on the pandas dtype of the user's DataFrame column.
- `.recall_plot(self, col_name, plot_type):`
  - Fetches data for most recently-created plot of provided type and redraws plot with it.
- `compare_plots(self, col_name):`
  - Creates a plt.subplots() figure of appropriate dimension to display all plots of all types for a specified DataFrame column

### Returns:
- None - is Class

### Current State:
- Alpha build
- Colorblind color palette active
- Data "snapshot" storage system implemented
  - Relies on storing a pd.Series of the data used for a given viz when that viz is created
  - Plot "recall/redraw" and basic comparative viz functionality implemented for histplots
    - plt.subplots() implementation with control-flow for proper axes object positioning and labeling

### Observed Bugs/Problems:
- `__init__.py` and `tadprep` import functionality has issues recognizing the `PlotHandler` class
  - Have to specify the following to enable instantiation of PlotHandler() class objects for testing:
    - 'from tadprep.core.tansforms import PlotHandler'
    - Unsure if this is expected behavior or if is issue with file structure

- `compare_plots` method failing to populate first column (histograms) in 2D case


### Ideas for Development:
- Testing will help indicate whether we should refactor `.det_plot_type()` and `_rename_and_tag_core` for more effective plot type determination.

- As color-blind friendly as we are capable of!
- Static viz only, stores and recalls "snapshots" of data for plotting

# Method: `extract_datetime`

### Core Purpose:
Extracts useful features from datetime columns in a dataframe, converting temporal information into features that 
machine learning models can use more effectively.

### Parameters:
- `df` Input Pandas dataframe.
- `datetime_features` (list[str] | None, default=None) Optional list of datetime features to process.
- `verbose` (Boolean, default=True) Controls level of detail/guidance in output.
- `preserve_features` (Boolean, default=False) Controls whether original datetime features are preserved.

### Extracted Components:
The following components are automatically extracted:
- year: Year component (e.g., 2023)
- month: Month component (1-12)
- day: Day of month (1-31)
- dayofweek: Day of week (0-6, where 0 is Monday)
- hour: Hour component (0-23)
- minute: Minute component (0-59)
- quarter: Calendar quarter (1-4)
- dayofyear: Day of year (1-366)
