# TADPREPS
*A personal project to generate a resilient end-to-end ML data preparation script for tabular data.*

### Background
The TADPREPS program (TAbular Data PREParation Script) is a unified, command line-executable data preparation script intended to streamline the data preparation process that is performed on nearly every tabular datafile before any form of advanced data analysis is applied.

While every analytical use case inevitably has its own particular corner cases and unique challenges, the steps invovled in tabular data preparation (especially assuming a naive-case approach) are reasonably consistent.

Writing fresh code to handle data preparation for each new project is labor-intensive and time-inefficient. Unless it is necessary that the data preparation process be scripted and applied within the scope of a given project, it is more efficient to take any flat, static data supplied by a customer/client/internal datasource, transform it using a single broadly-applicable script, and import the cleaned, processed data into the project.

TADPREPS leverages standard data preparation libraries, extensive error handling and logging, and a streamlined, lightweight UX intended to make the tabular data preparation process as smooth and low-effort as possible.

It can be run directly from the command line or within any standard IDE.
